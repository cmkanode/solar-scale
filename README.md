# solar-scale

Simple application that uses some basic data about our Sun and planets to calculate a scale based on the distance that you enter.  Simply select the last planet in your scale model (default is Neptune), and enter the distance in feet from the Sun to that last planet.

You should be able to open the homepage without running Node Express.  Just navigate to the public folder, and double-click (yes, I'm on Windows) on index.html.

**Note:** I have not verified my calculations.
